     <h1>My Opinion and Experience</h1>
     <p>My experience in this class has been both rewarding and challenging. I have encountered many ups and downs dealing with things I have never delt with ever before. Through this course, Mr. Evia has taught me so many new skills and assets. I now know how to formulate a professional page layout, take a professional photo, compile videos, and code for a new website. I was introduced to many new softwares that helped me foster this new knowledge and practice what I've learned. For example, I learned how to navigate Adobe Creative Cloud and Atom, a text editor site for coding.</p>
     <p>However, with all the new knowledge I learned, I came head to head with many new challenges. Learning anything new can be a little difficult at times. I found myself struggling with getting accustomed to the new softwares, tools, and resources. They were so complex and intricate, and there are so many layers to the tools. Still, struggling past these hardships gave me a sense of achievement and gratification. Accomplishing my final projects and seeing the finished product was rewarding. Dr. Evia was a great instructor. I think I'll earn an A in this class</p>
