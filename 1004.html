     <h1>Course Description</h1>
     <p>This course will introduce students to key principles in the field of sociology. The goal of this class is to provide individuals with an overview of theoretical perspectives, research areas, and general applicability of sociological concepts to everyday life. Students will be expected to grasp sociological approaches to understanding the world around them, as well as demonstrating an understanding of the application of theories and concepts.</p>
     <h1>Teacher's Biography: Kaitland Byrd</h1>
     <p>Kaitland Byrd teaches an online class for the Introduction to Sociology course. She teaches through powerpoints and online lectures to carry out her lessons. Dr. Byrd carries herself in an extremely professional manner and likes to be referred to as "Dr". Her interactions with students are efficient, strict, and straight to the point. She cares deeply about her course and the major itself, and takes sociology seriosuly as it applies to everyday life and history. Byrd teaches Social Inequality, Drugs and Society, as well as this course, all from the Sociolofy Department.</p><p>In all honesty, I don't know much about Mrs. Byrd. Due to the fact that this is an online course which she teaches, it's harder for me to know more about her or get to learn more about her. From what I can guage, she is a kind women, but keeps herself composed in a professional manner always for her peers and students.</p>
     <h1>My Opinion and Experience</h1>
     <p>Through this course I am able to apply the things I learn to everyday life. I've come to learn that sociology is prevalent throughout society and my day to day lifestyle. It's everywhere around me, at all times. This course is fairly easy and enjoyable for me. There is not too much heavy committment to the course, however I still am able to retain the information I need to know and gain new knowledge. I love that it is an online course so that I can work independently and on my own time. the workload is fairly medium and standard as to not stretch myself out too thin.</p><p>One complaint which I do have about the course happens to be the fact that it is online, thus making it harder for me to have interactions with my professor. When I need immediate help, I have to reach her through email and wait for a reply. I also know for a fact that I retain more information and knowledge when I learn in class and ask questions. Therefore, taking a self-paced, online course posed some challenges for me. Despite this, I currently have an A in this class.</p>
