     <h1>About me</h1><p> Hi, my name is Julia Shyy! I am an undergraduate student attending Virgnia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. I am majoring in Public Relations with a minor in Chinese Studies and Business Leadership. I hope to graduate in the spring of 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree from the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. Some of my interests include: media, photography, and writing.  Most of my classes are tailored towards these fields in relation to my major. I can't wait to fulfill the rest of my years here at Virginia Tech and explore new courses.</p>
