     <h1>My Opinion and Experience</h1>
     <p>This course was extremely fun and easy! I had a great time learning about the foundations of public relations. My major is public relations, so this course was really helpful and valuable. The course went over the basic knwoledge of public relations and challenged me to think in the way professional practitioners would. I utilized problem-solving skills and applied this knowledge to real world examples. I participated in class discussions where we talked about readings from the textbook. Working in teams was also really important. We often worked in groups in class to complete assignments and projects. Therefore, I gained teamwork skills for working with others. At times, the quizzes were difficult and challenging. Overall, this class was fun and useful to my own personal major. It was the right amount of challenging to make me think outside the box and push my boundaries. I am on track to get a B in this course and I've loved having McDaniel as my teacher.</p>
